This program will convert almost any image (PNG, JPG, JPEG and BMP) into QOI format.

Console version of Super QOI converter. Compatible with Linux, Mac and Windows

## How to use
This program can work in several ways:
- **As command so you can include it in your scripts:** It can receive paths and options from console parameters and will transform the images depending on the options you give to it. There are options like:
	- **-c:** Will copy the information from original files to the new files
	- **-d:** Will delete the original files when finishing
	- **-o:** Will overwrite existing files
	- And a lot more! Check **-h** option to get more information about options
- **As executable program:** If you don't provide paths or options, there won't be any problem since the program will ask you for paths if you don't provide anyone, or ask you for options too
